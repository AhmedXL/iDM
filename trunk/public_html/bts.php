		The main part of our drop system was released on December 20th and has been a great success. We still have some
		tweeking we want to do to make sure that our 'rare' drops aren't hugely common so the average drop is still the
		same as before but with a more varity of drops. We have been adding a few drops here and there to even thigns out
		but so far it seems good and is close to completion but we won't stamp it done till we reset which will be when
		this system is 100%.

<h3>Clan Hiscores</h3>

Infomation:

	<li>
		Our goal here is to create a similar hiscores that are used for money/wins/losses but for clans, there is
		many problems that we face here so this isn't something we are rushing on. Some of the problems we face
		is that not all the clans have the same amount of people so showing which clan has the most wins won't work
		since clans with 10+ people will have a greater advantage then a clan with 2 people.

		With the introduction of the ability to stack equipment items you get from drops we have noticed that some
		people like to keep their drops which causes a problem for us and them, what happens when they want to sell
		all of them? Well we have come up with a few ideas which will give you the ability to buy/sell using the
		site which allows you to 'queue' up items so you can see how much you will make or spend when buying/selling
		items.
